# Bed Teleport

This is a [Minecraft Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that adds a `/bed` chat command to teleport players back to their respawn point bed, costing them experience based on distance.

Development of the [Paper](https://papermc.io/) plugin concluded in May of 2021. It is still available on the [paper branch](https://github.com/viral32111/bed-teleport/tree/paper) and [1.0.0 release](https://github.com/viral32111/bed-teleport/releases/tag/1.0.0).
